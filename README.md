Mirae is a simple Todo application that lets users to create, update or delete todo list 
as well as sort them on the basis of priority. The app also provides a search menu to

## MVVM Architecture
My Android application adheres to the MVVM architectural pattern, which helps organize the 
code in a better way. This design separates different parts of the app so that they don't get 
mixed up and become hard to work with.
